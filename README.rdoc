== CIRCA: Circadian Gene Expression Profiles

Welcome to the CIRCA project. This is a data set of time course series data, highlighting circadian gene expression cycles through the use of the Cosopt algorithm for determining rhythmicity. 

It is  a Ruby on Rails application with a single controller and large data pre-set data set. Notable aspects include full-text search capability of gene annotation data via the Sphinx search engine, and data graphs dynamically produced by the Google Chart API.
